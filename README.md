"Estimating the Effects of Attitude Structure in Shaping Public Opinion: the significance of the political value structures underlying data simulations of information effects"

Authors: W. Zhang, L. Caughell and A. B. Cronkhite

Original Conference abstract: _Data simulations estimating information effects indicate that the low levels of political knowledge individuals possess alters the shape of collective opinion, and that information may even change the direction of collective preferences.  However, the method that scholars use to make these estimates involves an important assumptionâ€”that the value priorities of citizens change as their political knowledge increases. The research on information processing suggests that value priorities may precede political knowledge or that people may process new political information within their pre-existing value structures. This research raises a significant question for those studying political knowledge: If people become more informed and the value structure underlying their opinions does not change, what effects will information have on the collective opinions citizens express?  This paper uses agent based modeling to address this question, estimating how information affects collective preferences when the value structures underlying political preferences do not._
